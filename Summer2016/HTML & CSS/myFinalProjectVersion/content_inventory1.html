  <h2>List of the questions and their answers</h2><br><br>
  
      <dl>
      
          <dt>1- What did the client say that they want the web site to accomplish? Describe the goal of the  web site in one or two sentences. (Site Goals)</dt>
             <dd>
              <ul>
              <li> Explain their products and services</li>
              <li>Bring in new clients to your business</li>
              <li>Provide their customers with information on a certain subject</li>
              <li>Deliver news or calendar of events</li>
              <li>Sell a product or products online</li>
              </ul>
              In two sentences, they want a website to show that they have experience in this job for 33 years. The website should attract tutists and visitors, who
               want to explore Portland.
              </dd>
          
          <dt>2- Who is the intended audience? Who do you think will use the website? (Basic demographic information)</dt>
     
              <dd>Their target market are people who are interested in seeing and learning more about Portland, OR. Since the tours are in Portland,
              OR they want to reach people who are either in Portland or will be visiting Portland.<br> So, they just looking for domestic customers, mostly turists who
              may search the internet before coming in town or during their staying in town. They didn't have specific target market about their age or gender. I would
              ask mor question about their target market to have better view of what age and what income decile they targeted.
           
              </dd>
       
           <dt>3- What opportunity, problem, or issue did you hear that the client wants to address?  (Deeper dive into the site goal)</dt>
      
               <dd>They have more years experience and They provide a more complete tour experience compare to their competitors.<br>
               There are some steps thatwe must plan for it, the customer doesn't have any social network account, Email service, and hosting domain.
               They should start learning to know how these things work or oursource them to be mantained.
               </dd>
     
           <dt>4- What does the client want the site visitors to do? (call(s) to action)</dt>
      
               <dd>
                <ul>
                <li>Call them</li>
                <li>Fill out a contact form</li>
                <li>Search for information about their tours</li>
                <li>Book a tour</li>
                </ul>
               </dd>

           <dt>5- List at least two related or similar sites found on the Web and why you think they are related. What did you like about the websites
               and what do you think you could improve on for the client's website? (competitive analysis)</dt>
       
               <dd>
               <a href="http://www.portlandwalkingtours.com/">This is a Portland walking Tours website.</a><br>
               This one is similar because they have a list of tours about Portland. They have a good variety, but the index page is not attractive; it was so
               empty of soul and color. I would change the index page to be more attractive and colorful. I like that interactive menue in the first page, I would
               use such a menu in place if I know how.<br>
               <a href="http://www.portlandbysegway.com/">This one is Portland by Segway website.</a><br>
               This website introduce a fantastic way to explore the city; doing it by segway. It is a similar website because it provides Portland tour
               and it is a competitor.
               I would use better pictures (they are blurry), pluse I would resize the font of introduction of the website, and relocate and reshape
               it to be fitted under the main top picture. I liked the shadow of city for the end of the picture. If I know how, I would use it for my client.

         <li><a href="contact.html">Contact us</a></li>
      </ul>
       <p>I will not tall about pictures, we will use them as we need, for example the landscape picture of all portland are good for the home page,
       those with a specific location, depend on the where it is belong to (downtown, growth town, lankmark, or an action; like sign up), it will be use there. </p>
