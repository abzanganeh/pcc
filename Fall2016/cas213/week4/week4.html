<h1>FAQ in Development and Design</h1>

<dl>
    
    <dt>How long does it take to create a website?</dt>
    
    <dd>
        <p>The length of time it takes to create a fully functional website is based on several factors. Custom design work can take
        anywhere from 1 - 4 weeks, depending on the complexity of the design and the number of revisions you require. The development
        phase requires an additional 1 - 6 weeks, depending on the number of pages, and the functionality required. (According to Spritz Web Solutions)</p>

    <dt>What is the average cost for a website?</dt>
    
    <dd>
        <p>It is difficult to quote an average price, due to the enormous range in requirements for a site. According to BusinessWeek
        Online, a designer might charge $2,000 or more for a basic Web site, not including Web hosting fees. If you check out BuyerZone.com,
        you'll see that a 4 - 6 page template-based site will cost around $400, while a full custom design will come in closer to $800 - $1500.
        Other authoritative sources generally quote in the $1,000 - $2,000 range. (According to Spritz Web Solutions)</p>

    <dt>What is a CMS? </dt>
    
    <dd>
        <p>CMS stands for Content Management System. Simply put, it is a web-based tool for you to manage the text, images, and other content
        within your website. All you need is access to the internet. (According to visionary)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>What is a wireframe? </dt>
    
    <dd>
        <p>A wireframe is a visual representation of the requirements for a project. It may be a flow-diagram of a sitemap,
        or how information will be processed through a website. It may also be a high-level mock-up of how the proposed website might look.
        Wireframes don't include color-schemes and graphics. Think of it as someone sketching out a rough draft on paper. Wireframes are great
        ways for clients to understand and approve work to be done...especially with more complex projects that may include online forms.(According to visionary)</p>
      
    <dt>What is a project scope? </dt>
    
    <dd>
        <p>The easiest way to define project scope is to say that it is a blueprint where all necessary questions to be answered and problems
        to be solved are written out as well as a plan of action. Well-built websites are made with a lot of planning in order to function as
        needed, reach the right people, and accomplish all business goals. All information, documented for easy reference to keep everyone
        headed in the same direction is what project scope is about. It is similar to a website business plan but with a bit more purpose to
        help designers get final decisions from clients and keep development work organized. With a good record of scope, time and effort can
        be saved and communication problems minimized, enabling designers to actually build a website. (According to webunlimited)</p>

    <dt>What is a sitemap?</dt>
    
    <dd>
        <p>A sitemap is an outline of your website with a list of pages that will be included, and the navigation structure. Below is an example.
        The items in ALL CAPS would represent the top-level navigation (main links), and the others listed below would be pages linked through a
        drop-down menu. (According to visionary)</p>
      
    </dd>
    
     <dt>What is PHP?</dt>
    
    <dd>
        <p>PHP is a programming language. Unlike building straight HTML pages, we build database-driven website solutions. We use PHP to connect
        information stored within a database to the public-facing website pages. Yes, this is a VERY basic explanation, but if you want to learn
        more, just Google it! (According to visionary)</p>
      
    </dd>
    
    <dt>What is responsive web design? </dt>
    
    <dd>
        <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience —easy reading
        and simple, inuitive navigation with a minimum amount of resizing, panning, and scrolling by a site visitor — across a wide range of
        mobile devices, as well as traditional desktop computers. (According to visionary)</p>
